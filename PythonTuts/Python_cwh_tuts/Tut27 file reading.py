f = open("tut27 anant.txt", "rt")  # rt = default  # rb = binary
# content = f.read()
# print(content)
# content = f.read(456)  # 456 character read karlo ye kaha raha hai ye
# print(content)

# to print line by line thing we can iterate file using for loop

# for line in f:
#     print(line, end="")
# for line in content:  # will print character by character (don't make this mistake)

# for read a line in file we have to use this
# print(f.readline(), end="")
# print(f.readline(), end="")
# print(f.readline(), end="")

# Give a list of all line
# print(f.readlines())
